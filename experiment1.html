  <p>
    During routine Ga-68 generator elution and radiolabelling, an unusual incident was observed. A vial containing Ga-68 eluate turned green after approximately 48 hours. This unexpected color change raised suspicion of metal contamination, likely introduced from a metal needle or cannula during the elution or labelling process.

  <p>
    The green color suggested the presence of Fe²⁺, which is pale green in solution. To investigate further, hydrogen peroxide (to oxidize Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺) and DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) were added. The solution immediately turned bright yellow — strongly indicating formation of a Fe³⁺–DTPA complex.

  </figure>

  <p>
    DTPA is an acyclic chelator with five carboxyl and three amine groups, allowing rapid and stable complexation with metal ions like Fe³⁺ at room temperature. The yellow color corresponds to Fe³⁺ complexes with DTPA, confirming oxidation and complexation in real-time.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is particularly relevant in Ga-68 radiolabelling workflows. Fe³⁺, even in trace amounts, can compete with Ga³⁺ for chelators like DOTA or HBED-CC. According to Eppard et al. (2021), Fe³⁺ binds effectively to HBED-CC and may reduce labelling efficiency, especially in PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. This has implications for radiochemical purity and reproducibility.
